POJO Class : 

      --> A Java Class which implements or extends only Predefined Libraries 
      of Java Programming Language and doesn't implement or extends 
      Predefined Libraries of any other Technology or Framework is known as 
      POJO Class.

Note : 1.POJO Class are not against inheritance or implementing interfaces,they are
	against extending and Implementing Technology/Framework API Specific Class and
	Interface.

	2.POJO Class can hold pre-defined methods/logics of technolgy and
	framework.

	3.Annotations can be provided for POJO Class

	4.A Framework/Technology is said to be non-invasive only when its
	class are POJO Class

POJI[Plain Old Java Interface] :

	--> A Java Interface which extends only Predefined Libraries 
      of Java Programming Language and doesn't extends 
      Predefined Libraries of any other Technology or Framework is known as 
      POJO Class.

Note : 1.POJI Interface are not against inheritance or extending interfaces,they are
	against extending Technology/Framework API.

       2.Annotations can be provided for POJI Interface.

       3.POJI Interface can hold pre-defined methods/logics of technolgy and
	framework.

Java Bean Class
---------------

	1.The Java Class which is developed by following some special standards
	is Java Bean Class.

	Standards to be Followed
	------------------------

		a.Class scope must be public.
		b.Recommended to implement "java.io.Serializable"
		c.Class must have private and non-static variables[properties]
		d.Every Java Bean[Class] must have one getter and setter method
		e.Should have Public 0-Param Constructor Directly or Indirectly
	
	2.Java Bean Class is always as Helper Class,which is used to Carry
	Multiple Values as Single Objects between
	
		1.Two Layer/Components of Same Java Application
		Eg : Service Class[Business Logic] sends Multiple values to
		     DAO Class[Persistence Logic] in form of Java Bean Class
		     Object within the Application
		
			or
		
		2.Two Different Java Applications over network

		Eg : Flipkart.com sends credit/debit card details to Paypall
		in form of Java Bean Class Objects.

	3.Java Bean Class doesn't contain methods with business logic because
	it is always used as Helper Class.


FAQ : Why Designing a Java Method with more than 3 parameters is a bad practice?

Ans : R-1 : No.of.Arguments must be remembered
      R-2 : Order of Arguments must be remembered
      R-3 : Arguments values cannot be ignored
      R-4 : Arguments type must be remembered
      R-5 : If we don't pass value for arguments then default value cannot
	    be stored

FAQ : What If I pass Java Bean Class Reference as parameter?

Ans : R-1 : Order of properties need not be remembered,because data
	    can be set to Java Bean Class Object in any order.
      R-2 : No.of.properties need to not to be remembered because Java
	    Bean Class Object can hold multiple value.
      R-3 : Assigning values to properties of Java Bean Class can be
	    ignored
      R-4 : Since Setter and Getter Methods describes type of properties,hence
	    it is not required to remember type of properties
      R-5 : If we don't pass value for properties then default value is
	    stored by default.

Notes : Every Java Bean Class is a POJO Class but Every POJO Class cannot
	be Java Bean Class


(Session-009)

Bean Class/Component Class : A Java Class that has a State [Non-Static Member
Variables] and Behaviours[methods] where as the state must be used inside
Business Logics of Behaviour[methods] is known as Bean/Component Class.

Note : Bean Class <-- Named By Sun Microsystems
       Component Class <-- Named By Microsoft 

Example For Bean Class/Component Class :

	//Bean Class/Component Class
	public class BankOperations{
		//state
		private String bankName;
		private String bankBranch;
		private String bankBranchId;
		private String bankBranchIfsc;

		//behaviour
		public List<String> generateLockersInfo(){

		//Business Logic		

		return "....";
		}
	}

Note : 

       1.Bean Class/Component Class is different from Java Bean Class because
       Java Bean Class Methods are just Setter and Getter Methods where Bean/
       Component Class has Business Methods

       2.Java Compiler has no understanding of Java Bean,POJO,POJI and Component
	Class because these class standards are provided by programmers and
	not by Java Compiler

       3.Component Class can either be a POJO or non-POJO Class

       4.Service Class[Class with Business Logics] and DAO Class[Class with Persistence Logic]
	are examples of Bean Class/Component Class.

Container : Container is a Software Program which manages whole life cycle
	    of given resource[Class] end to end [from Birth to Death i.e from
	    Object Creation to Object Destruction]

	Servlet Container --> Manages Life Cycle of Servlet Components

	JSP Container --> Manages Life Cycle of JSP Components

	EJB Container --> Manages Life Cycle of EJB Components

	Spring Container --> Manages Life Cycle of Spring Beans/Components

Note : 1.Servlet/JSP/EJB Containers are heavy weight because they will be 
	created and activated only when heavy weight(memory,CPU time) Web
	Server[Tomcat] or Application Server [WebLogic] is started.

       2.Spring Containers are light weight because they can be started without
	starting Web Server or Application Server.

Spring Bean : 

	1.Java Class whose object is created and managed by Spring Container
	is Spring Bean

	2.Spring Bean can be 
			1.Pre-Defined
			2.User-Defined
			3.POJO
			4.Bean/Component
				Class

	3.Spring Bean cannot be
			1.Abstract Class
			2.Interface

	4.To Make Spring Container to Recognize and Manage Life Cycle of
	certain Java Class as Spring Bean,we need to mark that class in
	XML File or using Annotations

	XML File
	---------

		<bean id="dt" class="com.controller.Login">

		Note : 1.value for id attribute becomes "object name" for
			login Class
		      
                       2.Value for class attribute is fully Qualified Name
			of Spring Bean Class

	Annotations
	-----------

		In Annotation Environment,we mark Java Class as Spring Bean
		Using @Component Annotation

		Example:

		@Component("Bank")
		public class BankOperations{
		//state
		
		//behaviour
		}

		Note : The Value mentioned in Paranthesis of @Component is
		Object Name for Spring Bean Class

Spring Definition:

Spring is 
	1.Open Source
	2.Light Weight
	3.Loosely Coupled
	4.Non-Invasive
	5.Aspect Oriented  
		Framework to develop all types of Java,JEE Applications by
	getting Abstraction on multiple Java,JEE Technologies.

Open Source : It's source code can be used by people with free of cost.

Light Weight : Spring Framework compes in ZIP File having very less size.

		Spring supplies two built in container which are lightweight
		containers[we can create,activate spring containers by just
		creating object for a pre-defined class in any place]

Loosely Coupled : 1.We can develop an Application using Spring App using
		  some modules and leaving some modules.

		  2.Spring Libraries are given in form of jar files module
		  wise,so we can add required modules in form jar files

		  3.Spring Framework can be integrated with other
	          Java Framework and Java/JEE Technologies very easily.


	Loosely Coupled Definition : If DOD[Degree of Dependency] between
	two components is less.

	Eg : Android Phone and Type-C Charger

	Tightly Coupled Definition : If DOD[Degree of Dependency] between
	two components is more.

	Eg : IPhone and IPhone Charger

Non-Invasive : While Developing Classes in Spring Application,we can 
	       develop these classes without extending or implementing spring
		api interface and class,hence Spring Framework is Non-Invasive
		framework.

	The Classes having Application Logics are Ordinary Classes without
	having dependency with spring framework apis.So they can be moved to
	any other framework if needed.

Note : Every RealTime Application has two Logics,
		
	1.Primary[Must Required] Logics [Business Logics,Persistence Logics,Presentation Logic,etc]

	2.Secondary[Optional] Logics [Logging,Security,Auditing]

Aspect Oriented : 

	In OOP[Object Oriented Programming] Style Programming we mix up both
	Primary and Secondary Logics in the Business Methods,hence we face the
	following limitations,
		
	1.There is no clear seperation between Primary and Secondary Logics,
	because they are mixedup

	2.Modifications done in Secondary Logic affects Primary Logic.

	3.Enabling or disabling the secondary Logic without disturbing the
	primary Logic isn't possible.	

To Overcome these problems,go for Aspect Oriented Style Programming,

	--> AOP cannot replace OOP,infact AOP Compliments OOp i.e AOP=OOP+

	--> ASPECT in AOP is Secondary Logic

	--> In AOP Style Programming,We Develop both logics in seperate Class
	and mix them at runtime with help of AOP s/w like SpringAOP,etc...	

	-->SpringAOP generates InMemory Proxy Class(A Class which gets generated
	,executed and vanished at runtime [from jvm start to end] in JVM memory
	of RAM)

Advantages of using AOP Style Programming

	1.There is clear seperation between Primary and Secondary Logics.

	2.Modifications done in Secondary Logic doesn't affect Primary Logic.

	3.Enabling or disabling the secondary Logic without disturbing the
	primary Logic isn't possible.	

	4.It is Industry Standard.
